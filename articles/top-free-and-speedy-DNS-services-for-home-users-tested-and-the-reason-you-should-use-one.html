    <h1>Top free and speedy DNS services for home users tested and the reason you should use one</h1>
    <div class="date">Publishing date: June 23, 2020</div>

Well, I am no expert here, but for starters, we must know what DNS stands for and how it impacts our web surfing and online privacy. The internet runs on ip addresses - 216.58.214.206, perhaps is for Google.com. Test by typing it into your address bar.

But they are too hard to remember, right? And so, we need a "phonebook" for the internet.
Unless that data with our DNS provider is encrypted
Internet service providers (ISPs) have their own DNS servers, and they can 

    <h2>User privacy</h2>
DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) are still sorta new, and have major importance in having a more secure internet. Unless you are running a secure DNS of the aforementioned types, the sites you visit can easily be tracked by your current internet service provider.

    <h2>Speed</h2>
It's not strictly about speed, but rather latency, aka, the time to establish a connection with a server. The use of a crappy Domain Name Service can bog down your latency, mostly important to competitive online gamers, though, not limited to.

    <h2>My first choice</h2>
    <ul><h3><li>Quad9</li></h3></ul>
    <ul>Primary: 9.9.9.9<br>
Secondary: 149.112.112.112<br>
DoT: dns.quad9.net<br></ul>

Quad9 is being run by a US-based non-profit organization and because they can't monetize their product, Quad9 relies solely on donations and is funded by IBM.

    <h2>Alternatives</h2>
In case you don't trust Google and Cloudflare because they do collect logs and certain types of personal data for debugging reasons, yet, they may still easily outperform Quad9 in select regions of the world due to having a broader network infrastructure.

    <ul><h3><li>Cloudflare</li></h3></ul>
    <ul>Primary: 1.1.1.1<br>
Secondary: 1.0.0.1<br>
DoT: 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com<br></ul>

    <ul><h3><li>Google</li></h3></ul>
    <ul>Primary: 8.8.8.8<br>
Secondary: 8.8.4.4<br>
DoT: dns.google<br></ul>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>
The most straightforward way is to set up your preferred DNS directly through your router. Depending on your router maker, model, and firmware revision, the settings GUIs significantly vary. Make sure to scour through each and every option until you see the <b>DNS server</b> options.

Newer versions of Android (9 and above) have built-in support for DNS-over-TLS, which is very easy to set up and there isn't a single reason not to.

    <h2>Closing words</h2>
The Internet being a decentralized domain does have its implications as to who can track you and whom do you have to stray as far away as you can (um, Facebook).
