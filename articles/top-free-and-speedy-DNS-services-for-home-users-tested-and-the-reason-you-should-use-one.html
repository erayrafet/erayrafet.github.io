    <h1>Top free and speedy DNS services for home users tested and the reason you should use one</h1>
    <div class="date">Publishing date: June 23, 2020</div>

For started, we must know what DNS stands for and how it impacts our Internet speeds and online privacy.
Lousy Internet service providers (ISPs)

    <h2>User privacy</h2>
DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)

    <h2>Speed</h2>
It's not strictly about speed, but rather latency, aka, the time to establish a connection with a server. The use of a crappy Domain Name Service can bog down your latency, mostly important to competitive online gamers, though, not limited to.

    <h2>My first choice</h2>
    <ul><li>Quad9</li></ul>
Primary: 9.9.9.9
Secondary: 149.112.112.112
DoT: dns.quad9.net
    <h2>Alternatives</h2>
In case you don't trust Google Cloudflare because they do collect logs and other types of personal data for debugging issues, yet they may still easily outperform Quad9 in select regions of the world due to having a broader network base.

<ul><li>Cloudflare</li>
Primary: 1.1.1.1
Secondary: 1.0.0.1
DoT: 1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com
<li>Google</li>
Primary: 8.8.8.8
Secondary: 8.8.4.4
DoT: dns.google
</ul>
    <h2>Configuration</h2>
The most straightforward way is to set up your preferred DNS directly through your router. Depending on your router maker, model, and firmware revision, the settings GUIs significantly vary. Make sure to scour through each and every option until you see the <b>DNS server</b> options.

Newer versions of Android (9 and above) have built-in support for DNS-over-TLS, which is very easy to set up and there isn't a single reason not to.

    <h2>Closing words</h2>
The Internet being a decentralized domain does have its implications as to who can track you and whom do you
