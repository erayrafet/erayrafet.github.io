    <title>The best PWAs</title>

    <h1>The best PWAs on the Internet</h1>
    <p>Progressive Web Apps is part of Google's effort at unifying the web, so to speak. They are simple websites, under the PWA naming umbrella, with native app-like functions. For example, there is the auto dark/light mode based on user' preferences set on the OS level, maskable icons, custom title bar colors, and push notifications. Upcoming features include app shortcuts (planned to ship with Chrome 84-85) like those on Android and running applications at device startup.<br>Supported are most browsers based on the Chromium engine, i.e., Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, and Microsoft's new Edge too.</p>

    <h2>Installing PWAs</h2>
    <p>To install a PWA, look for a plus (➕) icon on the right-hand side of the address bar on desktop devices and on mobile you'll see a pop-up at the bottom suggesting that you add an app to your home screen. It's super easy, isn't it?</p>

    <h2>Suggestions</h2>

    <ul><li><a href=https://music.youtube.com>YouTube Music</a></li>
    <p>Google's recent transition from Play Music to YouTube Music accelerated the development of the YouTube Music web app. They even added an option to upload music files.<br>It is now decently performing and pretty much a joy to use, aside from a few quirks here and there.</p></ul>

    <ul><li><a href=https://open.spotify.com/>Spotify</a></li>
    <p>Spotify is also great at bringing the necessity of features required for a perfect music listening user experience, without you needing to download multiple apps on multiple computers.</p></ul>

    <p>This is a very well thought, sleek-looking cross-platform file sharing web app that support mobile as well as desktop.</p></ul>
    <ul><li><a href=https://send.firefox.com>Firefox Send</a></li>
    <p>Firefox Send offers similar functionality to Snapdrop, but with a twist. Instead of transferring files only over a local network, everything goes through the Internet with full end-to-end encryption for those of us who are privacy conscious. Maximum file size allowed is 2.5GB.</ul>

    <h2>PWA stores</h2>
Ultimately, it all boils down to one thing - having easy access. By that, I mean that we need some type of a centralized place to get apps which is more convenient than hunting over the Internet and it's proven to be the best method,. After recent changes to the Play Store, Google added optional PWA installations, and if you are on a Chromebook, you get those by default (Twitter, for example).
But there are two places worth taking a peek at:
    <ul><li><a href=https://appsco.pe>Appscope</a></li>
    <img src="./images/appscope.png"></ul>
    <ul><li><a href=https://pwainside.com>PWA Inside</a></li>
    <img src="./images/pwa-inside.png"></ul>
    
    <h2>Bonus tip</h2>
Well, all Chromium-based browsers give you the option of running websites in their own windows. Take as an example YouTube. After the recent queue feature rollout, it is suitable at running in a standalone window exactly like the mobile app.<br>To make that happen, click on the three-dot menu on the right for Chrome and Edge user and select 'Create shortcut/Install app'. The same applies to all websites.
  <br><br>
My favorite non-web apps (those that do not fit the PWA standards) are Telegram React, Discord, Twitch, Reddit, GitHub, Gmail, Google Keep, as well as a few others.
