    <title>The best PWAs</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>The best PWAs on the Internet</h1>
    <p>Progressive Web Apps is part of Google's effort at unifying the web, so to speak. PWAs are simple websites, under the PWA naming umbrella, with native app like functions. For example, there is the auto dark/light mode based on user' preferences set on the OS level, maskable icons and push notifications. Upcoming features include app shortcuts (Chrome 84-85) like those on Android and running at device startup.<br>Supported are most browsers based on the Chromium engine, i.e., Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, and Microsoft's new Edge as well.</p>

    <h2>Installing PWAs</h2>
    <p>To install a PWA, look for a plus (➕) icon on the right-hand side of the address bar on desktop and on mobile you'll see a pop-up at the bottom suggesting you to add an app to the home screen. It's super easy, isn't it?</p>

    <h2>Bonus tip</h2></body>
Well, all Chromium-based browser give you the option of running every website in its own window. Take as an example YouTube. After the recent queue feature rollout, it is suitable at running in a standalone window exactly like the mobile app.<br>To make that happen, click on the three-dot menu on the right for Chrome and Edge user and select 'Create shortcut'/'Install app'. The same applies to all websites.
  <br><br>
My favorite non-standard web apps are Telegram React, Discord, Twitch, Reddit, GitHub, as well as a few others.
